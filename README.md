# FoodMatch
Can’t decide where to eat for dinner? FoodMatch is here to help. Whether it be deciding as a group of friends or as a couple, FoodMatch is designed to find the overall preference of everyone to ensure that everyone has an enjoyable dining experience. By taking into account each person’s taste, groups can anonymously decide what to eat without anyone feeling like they are sacrificing something. So the next time your friends or spouse say “I’m fine with anything,” let FoodMatch do the planning.

How does it work? FoodMatch takes restaurants near the city your profile is set up for and organizes them in a easy to read card format for which you can decide yes or no. For all the yeses that everyone chooses, these restuarants will be shown to everyone as mutual agreements. In the future, we plan to integrate a random restuarant generator so it will automatically pick restuarants from those that everyone agrees as well as further implement yelp api to categorize restaurants and provide more information on each one.
